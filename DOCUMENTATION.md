# 📘 AI BUILDER DOCUMENTATION

## 🤖 How it Works
This project is managed by an **Autonomous AI Engineering Engine**. It doesn't just build once; it learns and optimizes continuously.

### 🏠 Folder Structure
- `src/`: Core source code (App, Components, Lib).
- `src/db/`: Drizzle ORM schemas and database configuration.
- `ARCHITECTURE_REASONING.md`: AI's tactical decisions.
- `TODO_LIST.md`: Live progress and task tracker.
- `LEARNING_MEMORY.json`: AI's persistent knowledge base.

### 🔄 Sustainable Development (The Loop)
1. **Self-Improvement**: AI reviews logic randomly and upgrades it.
2. **Auto-Git**: Every major optimization is pushed to GitHub automatically.
3. **Atomic Operations**: Prevents file corruption even if power is lost.

## 🚀 Post-Action
Run `npm install` and `npx drizzle-kit migrate` to start.

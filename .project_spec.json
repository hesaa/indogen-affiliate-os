  "architectural_reasoning": "The file structure follows Next.js 16.1.6 App Router best practices with all source code inside the 'src/' directory as mandated. The architecture separates concerns clearly: API routes handle business logic, components are organized by feature, and workers handle background processing. The use of Bun runtime ensures maximum performance for video rendering tasks, while Redis provides efficient job queue management. Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL offers type-safe database operations. The structure supports scalability through modular design, allowing easy addition of new features like GPU rendering or additional automation tools. The credit-based system and unique domain rotation address the critical evaluation points about scalability and AI detection, ensuring long-term viability of the platform."

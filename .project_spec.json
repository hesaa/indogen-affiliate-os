  "architectural_reasoning": "The proposed architecture follows Next.js 16.1.6 App Router best practices with all source code inside the 'src/' directory. The file structure is organized by feature, with API routes, components, and utilities separated logically. The use of Bun runtime with Redis queue and FFmpeg workers ensures scalable video rendering, while Drizzle ORM provides type-safe database operations. The architecture addresses the critical business goals by implementing all four pillars: Smart Content Rotator for anti-shadowban, Automated Comment Sniper for conversion boosting, Advanced Link Cloaker for safety, and Micro-Landing Page Generator for trust building. The credit-based system and unique domain rotation address the intellectual sparring recommendations for scalability and AI detection avoidance."
